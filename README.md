    - Graphs
    - Hashing

5. **Algorithms**
    - Searching
        - Linear Search
        - Binary Search
    - Sorting
        - Bubble Sort
        - Quick Sort
        - Merge Sort

6. **Advanced Topics**
    - Trie
    - Segment Trees
    - Fenwick Trees
    - Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

7. **Practice Problems**
    - Beginner Problems
    - Intermediate Problems
    - Advanced Problems

8. **Conceptual Questions and Answers**
    - **What is the difference between an Array and a Linked List?**
        - Arrays have a fixed size, while linked lists are dynamic in size. Arrays allow random access, whereas linked lists allow sequential access.
    - **What is the time complexity of searching in a binary search tree?**
        - The time complexity is O(log n) for balanced trees and O(n) for unbalanced trees.
    - **What is the purpose of Big O notation?**
        - Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of an algorithm's efficiency in terms of time and space as input size grows.
    - **Explain the difference between Stack and Queue.**
        - A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, while a queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.
    - **What is dynamic programming?**
        - Dynamic programming is a technique to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, storing their results to avoid redundant calculations.
    - **When would you use a Trie?**
        - A Trie is used for efficient retrieval of strings, such as in autocomplete features.
